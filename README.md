## Liver-Disease-Prediction
#Introduction
The Liver Disease Prediction project is a machine learning-based system that predicts the likelihood of a patient having liver disease based on various attributes. The system leverages multiple machine learning algorithms and provides valuable insights into patient health conditions.

#Features
Liver disease prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, AdaBoost, Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoost, and Extra Tree Classifier.
Data preprocessing techniques to handle missing data and encode categorical variables.
Evaluation metrics to assess model performance, including accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
